# Introduction

These [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL) projects target the [Digilent Basys 3 Artix-7 Fpga Trainer Board](https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/). 

The Basys 3 is a demo board for the Xilinx [Artix-7 FPGA](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/artix-7.html). Significant features of the Basys 3 are 12-bit VGA output, along with switches, LEDs and seven-segment display that can be utilized in your deisgn. The Basys 3 incorporates the XC7A35T-1CPG236C FPGA device and is designed exclusively for Xilinxâ€™s Vivado Design Suite. The Vivado ML Edition is available as a free download from AMD. 

[Vivado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivado) was introduced in 2012 and superceded the Xilinx ISE software which had targeted previous generations of Xilinx FPGA and PLD devices such as the Spartan series. [Xilinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xilinx) invented the first commercially viable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in 1984. Xilinx was acquired by AMD in 2022.
